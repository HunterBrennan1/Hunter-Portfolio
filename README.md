# Hunter-Portfolio-project

This website displays my portfolio and provides a responsive design that can be navigated easily via the nav bar. This website includes 4 sections labled as "About Me" "work" "contact me" and "resume" each representing there own values appropriatly. 

The main "hero" section displays my name and links to my socials which include Twitter, Github, And Linkedin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "about me" section includes a photo of myself and a brief description of my interests and love for learning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "work" section illustrates 3 projects i've worked on with only 1 responsive image that brings you to the deployed application of a "cheat sheet" project I worked on in school.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "contact me" section displays a form that provides an option to reach out to me via name and email with a section to add additional information about the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "resume" section provides information about my qualifications and dev languages I use so far throughout my developer course.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I am not fully happy with the design and layout of the portfolio, I am confident that that functionality is something I will be able to add onto as my skills increase.
